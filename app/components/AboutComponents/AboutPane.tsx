          I&apos;m a freelance consultant that has deep interests in all technologies, and like to try around all about the new software, system and
          tools available. I enjoy understanding how everything works, and discovering new atmospheres. That is why consulting is a perfect mix in
          which I can apply my skills, while discovering news projects and way of doing things.
